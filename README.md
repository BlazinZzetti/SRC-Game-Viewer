# SRC-Game-Viewer
Quick and dirty program that uses the C# API Interface for SRC to organize and few runs of a game on SRC

A bit slow, probably due to not getting all the data before creating the items for the tree view.
Still need to add a way to export a list with all of the run data that's excel safe.
