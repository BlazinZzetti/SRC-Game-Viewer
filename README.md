# SRC-Game-Viewer
Quick and dirty program that uses the C# API Interface for SRC to organize and few runs of a game on SRC

Slowness is likely due to how I am requesting SRC data. Probably could be faster if I use the wrapper API better.  At least I confirmed that it's not the creation of the GUI tree.

It is now possible to export data to a .CSV file for use in Excel or Sheets.  Shouldn't be too hard to add other file types, but I will deal with that when needed.
